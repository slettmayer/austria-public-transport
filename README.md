# Austria Public Transport (Wiener Linien & ÖBB)

Home Assistant custom integration for Austrian public transport: real-time Vienna departures from the [Wiener Linien OGD Realtime API](https://www.wienerlinien.at/ogd_realtime) and Austrian rail data from the [ÖBB Scotty API](https://fahrplan.oebb.at).

Can be used standalone or together with [vienna-transport-card](https://github.com/0Paul89/vienna-transport-card).

## Installation

**Requires Home Assistant 2026.3.0 or newer** (the version from which the integration's brand icons are served).

### HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS: **Integrations** → three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/slettmayer/austria-public-transport` with category **Integration**.
3. Search for **"Austria Public Transport"** in HACS, install it, and restart Home Assistant.

Once the integration is accepted into the HACS default store, you can skip the custom-repository step and search for it directly.

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/austria_public_transport/` into your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory and restart.

## Setup

Add the integration through the UI:

**Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → "Austria Public Transport"**

Enter one or more Wiener Linien stop IDs (comma-separated). You can find stop IDs with [till.mabe.at/rbl](https://till.mabe.at/rbl/).

Each stop becomes a sensor entity whose:
- **State:** number of upcoming departures
- **Attributes:** stop name, next departures (line, direction, countdown, planned/real time, accessibility info), server time

ÖBB train data (station search, departure boards, trip search, service alerts) is available on demand through the **services** below — no configuration required.

## Services

### `austria_public_transport.fetch_departures`

Fetches all departures for a given Wiener Linien stop ID on demand (returns data directly, does not update sensors).

  stop_id: "4609"
response_variable: departures
```
